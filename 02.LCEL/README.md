# LangChain Expression Language Project 🚀

### Build a Simple LLM Application with LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
In this quickstart we'll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it's just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain.

After implementing this project, you'll have a high level overview of:

- Using language models

- Using PromptTemplates and OutputParsers

- Using LCEL to chain components together

- Debugging and tracing your application using LangSmith

- Deploying your application with LangServe

## After executing simplellmLCEL.ipynb code follow the below steps:
1. run serve.py script with:
```bash
python serve.py
```

2. open another terminal with command prompt on Visual Studio code
3. run client.py script with:
```bash
streamlit run client.py
```
